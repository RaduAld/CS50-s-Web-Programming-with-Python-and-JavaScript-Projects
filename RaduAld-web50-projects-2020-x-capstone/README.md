Overview:
The project I've created consist in a online platform made for my school which connects students,teachers and parents easier. There are three types of users for each mentioned category that are able to do different things. The website's structure is molded by the Romainian educational system, where there are different grades ordered alfabetical (e.g. 9A, 9F, 12C with different profiles focused on different subjects (maths/romanian/science), and grades are between 1 and 10. Each class has their own principal teacher which is responsible with the supervision of the students in that class.

Students
 - can view their subjects, their grades, homework and can ask the teachers different questions
 - they also is a page dedicated to the display of all grades

Parents
 - can only view the grades and homework
 - when registering, parents need to provide a number which represents the id of the child they want to connect to, which should be provided by the administrator of the site

Teachers
 - all teachers have the ability to create their own class in which they can select which students to be in
 - can create subjects each of them designed for a specified class
 - in each subject they can add grades, assign homework, view all grades for each student and have discussions with the students in the subject's page

I think that this project is different than the others because it's a small educational platform which can be used to help students stay in contact with their teavhers, homework ad grades while also letting the parents see their children status. As for the complexity of the project, I believe that I've implemented new things such as a modified user model and effective files that show different information on the page deppending on the user's role(student, teacher or parent), but most importantly the application is written from scratch, with the information acquired from the CS50 Cource.
